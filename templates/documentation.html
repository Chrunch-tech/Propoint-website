                then you simply have to type
                <span class="command_palette_example">A + B</span> and this
                automatically generate a new column for you and if you want to
                add
                <span class="command_palette_example">column A and B</span> and
                put it equal to another column
                <span class="command_palette_example">C</span> then you just
                simply have to type
                <span class="command_palette_example">C = A + B</span> and this
                will put <span class="command_palette_example">C</span> equal to

              <h2>Merge conflict</h2>
              <hr />
              <p>
                In this section we'll talk about merge conflict error. What is
                it and How to avoid it.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>What is merge conflict?</h3>
              <p>
                Merge conflict is an error which is happen when two merging cell
                has conflicting difference <i>for example</i> let's say you have
                add two column
                <span class="command_palette_example">A and B</span> you enter
                the command in the command palette and you hit execute then what
                going to happen now that propoint will read all the cell in that
                columns and attempt to add them if cell
                <span class="command_palette_example">a1</span> and
                <span class="command_palette_example">b1</span> have not same
                values means a1 is equal to a word and b1 is equal to a number
                that's where this error is occour
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>How to avoid this error?</h3>
              <p>
                First of all make the selected column don't have conflicting
                changes but if it still happen then Propoint ask you to
                <span class="command_palette_example">Overwrite</span> and
                <span class="command_palette_example">Don't Overwrite</span>
                So what are this:
                <br />
                <br />
                <i>Overwrite -</i> In this case Propoint will overwrite the
                target cell with a empty cell.
                <br />
                <i>Don't overwrite -</i> In this case Propoint don't overwrite
                the target cell it will put it equal to its value.
